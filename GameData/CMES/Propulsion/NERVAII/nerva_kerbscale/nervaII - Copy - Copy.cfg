description = Lighter and more powerful, this NTR engine is the ultimate propulsion device.

Historically the engine was proposed to be launched atop a derivative of the Saturn V. In orbit it would be docked and assembled into a three-stage interplanetary vessel with up to four of these engines used to launch a significant manned mission to the red planet.
